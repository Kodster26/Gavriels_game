-- GAV'RIEL'S GAME --

Premise:

Simple game in which players, designated into separate colour groups, must use their tools to control the gameboard.
Once a tile is coloured, it is protected for either x turns or x amount of time, before it is reset! Players found
on enemy tiles at the end of each turn/timecycle are damaged a given amount. Make sure you, or your team are the
last on the board!

Paradigms:

- No breakable nodes
- Only use one node register for colored tiles
- Neutral and ally tiles are safe, enemy tiles are not


Gameplay:

The board (variable size) starts out completely neutral. Teams are spread out on the board.
When the game begins, players can use one of a few tools to perform various actions, usually
colouring neutral tiles their team color. Players must always move each turn, and at the end of each turn the 
tiles that were previously rest on are lost permanently.

SETTINGTYPES

- Used to denote conditions that the game will use during operation.

-- "setting_SIZE" (Size of the board, always square.)

-- "has_GUARDRAIL" (Boolean value indicating whether the stage is guarded or not.)

-- "spawn_DIST":
    uniform = "player positions are arranged in a loosely uniform order, generally starting with edges, players
    are loaded in at a distance of [setting_size] until the 5th player, who is then loaded in at [setting_SIZE]/2
    and so on. (may rework in future after testing.)"

    randomform = "player positions are randomly selected."

    coliform = "player positions are arranged in tight little clusters around the center of the map"

-- "item_DIST":
    default = "players start with all default game items, unlimited use."
    
    looty = "players start with no extra items, but have the default brush and can pick up items from bags."
    
    guerilla = "players start with nothing but the default brush, but also have combat knives. Stabbing an enemy
    player will harm the player as though they ended a turn on an enemy tile."

    guiacol = "Not even vanilla, players have only brushes and no other items."

    ishihara = "Colourblind mode, or naw."
